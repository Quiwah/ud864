# React Map Project

This app is the project #7 of [Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

I build it to help people who are planning to visit Japan, by providing recommended places with photos and information on the map. User can filter the result by area and/or genre.
